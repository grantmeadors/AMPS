To run each section of the feedforward project
known as AMPS (Auxiliary MICH-PRC Subtraction),
follow these instructions.

Setup: 
0. Login to "pulsar@ldas-grid.ligo.caltech.edu"
1. Make a directory of the form "~pulsar/feedforward/yyyy/mm/dd/",
    where yyyy is current year, mm month and dd day, and cd there.
2. Download the latest git repository, 
    "git clone git@github.com:grantmeadors/AMPS.git"
3. cd to the AMPS directory. Note, only the main pulsar account
    will be able to access all functions.

Segment query:
0. Call "./getS6H1segs" to query S6 segments. Modify for observatory as needed
    and copy output segment list to "seglist.txt"

Segment division:
0. Start Matlab, any recent version, e.g. "matlab -nodisplay"
1. Trim the raw S6 seglist, "seglist.txt", into "dividedSeglist.txt",
    using "segmentDivider(start GPS time, stop GPS time)",
    which searches for S6 segments between the start and stop times
    and divides segments longer than a certain duration. It also
    returns only the first N such segments,
    where N is coded in segmentDivider.

Cache and submit file creation:
0. Text edit "createEleutheriaDagSubmitFile.py" to ensure that 
    analysisDate has the current "yyyy/mm/dd" value 
1. Call "./createEleutheriaDagSubmitFile.py" to generate a cache
    of ligo_data_find locations for S6 data and a Condor DAG submission file
    for feedforward. Note that this can take a few minutes or more 
    for every hundred segments. 

Compiling main feedforward program:
0. Call "source bashrc" while logged in as user pulsar@ldas-grid.caltech.edu
1a. Run the Matlab compiler: "mcc -mv eleutheria.m"
1b. For better memory performance, run the Matlab 2012a compiler with
    "/ldcg/matlab_r2012a/bin/mcc -mv -R -nodisplay -R -nojvm -R -singleCompThread eleutheria.m"
    and note it may only compile on gmeadors, depending on env,
    but it runs with a sourced bashrc on pulsar.

Submitting main feedforward Condor jobs:
0. Submit to the CIT cluster nodes with "condor_submit_dag EleutheriaDAG.dag"
1. Watch progress and verify done with "condor_q pulsar" checks and
    reading the output logs.

Filling in interstitial frames:
0. Create the frames in between science segments after the main feedforward
    jobs are completed.
1.  Text edit "createInterstitialCondorSubmitFile.py"
    to ensure that analysisDate has the current "yyyy/mm/dd".
2. Run "./createInterstitialCondorSubmitFile.py"
3. Compile "mcc -mv interstitialFrame.m"
4. Submit "condor_submit InterstitialSub.sub"

Post-processing basic plots:
0. Produce basic plots of range and verify log file output by starting
    "matlab2010b -nodisplay" and invoking "postProcessing"
    (note: first verify that it is reading all the logs 
    and in the right directory)

Spectral scan (optional):
0. Choose the first AMPS frame from a science segment
    longer than 12288 seconds.
1. Start "matlab2010b -nodisplay" 
2. Run "spectralScan(framename)", where framename is the name of
    the first frame only, not including the directory name.

Comb spectrum (optional):
0. Edit "combSpectrum.py" to process all the output diagnostic directories.
1. Run "combSpectrum.py", review output plots in those same directories.

Perusing frames:
0. When at least main feedforward jobs are done, inspect the frames
    for structural errors and check injection syncronization.
1. Text edit "createPeruseCondorSubmitFile.py"
    to ensure that analysisDate has the current "yyyy/mm/dd".
2. Text edit "peruseManyFrames.py"; 
    (optional) if desired, to ensure that its testBit is
    set to allow the "catter" function to perform its check, that
    "particularRun" is set to the date of the relelvant feedforward run,
    and the the range of jobs equals the number of feedforward jobs.
    This checks to see if "No data found" errors appear in the logs.
3. Compile "mcc -mv peruseFrame.m"
4. Submit "condor_submit PeruseSub.sub"

SFT generation:
0. Follow the following BASH commands to make SFTs for AMPS data:
1. "ligo_data_find -o H -t H1_AMPS_C02_L2 -u file -s 931052708 -e 971622015 -u file --show-times > SFTsegsTestData.txt"
2. "./compareSegLists.tcl -f1 dividedSeglist.txt -f2 segsH1ScienceMinusAllVetoes_AllS6VSR2VSR3times.txt -i > SFTsegsTestList.txt"
3. "./compareSegLists.tcl -f1 SFTsegsTestList.txt -f2 SFTsegsTestData.txt -i > SFTsegsTestIntersection.txt"
4a. "MakeSFTDAG -f SFTtukey.dag -G SFTTUKEY -d H1_AMPS_C02_L2 -x 128 -k 30 -F 38 -B 2000 -T 1800 -p /archive/frames/S6/pulsar/sfts/feedforward/tukey -N H1:AMPS-STRAIN -m 1 -g SFTsegsTestIntersection.txt -o /usr1/pulsar -v 2 -D 3 -X AMPSC02L2 -u ADC_REAL8"
OR
4b. "MakeSFTDAG -f SFThann.dag -G SFTHANN -d H1_AMPS_C02_L2 -x 128 -k 30 -F 38 -B 2000 -T 1800 -p /archive/frames/S6/pulsar/sfts/feedforward/hann -N H1:AMPS-STRAIN -m 1 -g SFTsegsTestIntersection.txt -o /usr1/pulsar -v 2 -D 3 -X AMPSC02L2 -u ADC_REAL8 -w 3 -P 0.5"
5a. "condor_submit_dag SFTtukey.dag"
OR
5b. "condor_submit_dag SFThann.dag"

Spectral averaging
0. Modify, as needed for observatory or directory, "runspecS6H1feedforward"
1. Run "./runspecS6H1feedforward"

Spectral average plot generation:
0. Start "matlab2010b -nodisplay"
1. Run "fullspect", "fullspectDiff" or "fullspectZoom" as desired for plots.

Website generation:
0. Run scripts "./headerWriterDiagnostics.py" and
    "./headerWriterSciencesegments.py"
